## 2025-05-18 - Nginx Config Memoization in React Tool
**Learning:** Config generator functions produce multi-line strings via array concatenation and conditionals. When React components re-render (e.g. state/prop updates or parent re-renders), recalculating these generator functions on every render frame creates garbage collection pressure and unnecessary thread processing.
**Action:** Wrap config generator function calls and derived bash one-liners in `useMemo([settings, lang])` in all generator tool components.
